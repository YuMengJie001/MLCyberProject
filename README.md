## How to Run Code:

**For approach Find-Prune:** We uploaded a pdf and a completed python code that used for obtained fine_pruned models.

**For input images that for testing:** Please use the eval script and put the test image into the data floder(MLCyberProject/data).

**For evaluating the model, execute eval.py by running:**  
python3 eval_*.py </data directory>  
E.g  
python3 eval_anonymous_1.py data/test_image.png
